a random hodge-podge of notes on people to contact, papers to follow up, keywords to search for, etc.

browse HCI journals of the last few years to look for people to contact -- even related but not identical ideas should be good people to ask about whether there's work in the area

...related to constraint lenses, which will likely have to appear in some form or other if we're going to allow locking cells in the spreadsheet:
constraint logic programming
convex hulls (what are these?)

Bidirectional transformation of model-driven spreadsheets
  - Model-driven spreadsheets describe the structure of the spreadsheet
  - the bidirectional transformations here convert between different spreadsheet models
Towards the bidirectionalization of spreadsheet formulas
  - Poster abstract, describes idea for lenses as bidirectional formulas in spreadsheet cells
  - Very relevent, and the group might be doing current work in the area. Contact?

Constraint Programming and Spreadsheets
---------------------------------------
* A spreadsheet interface for logic programming: http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=67450.67466
* Practical applications of constraint programming: http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.43.9494&rep=rep1&type=pdf
  - 1995 survey of constraint programming
* A spreadsheet based on constraints: http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=168642.168664
  - very relevant! instead of giving formulas for particular cells, the relationship between cells is specified and an update to any of the related cells causes the others to recompute
* An explanation-based, visual debugger for one-way constraints: http://academic.research.microsoft.com/Publication/1242101/an-explanation-based-visual-debugger-for-one-way-constraints
  - allowing people to run a spreadsheet "backwards" to figure out why a particular cell has a particular value

Multi-way Constraints and Spreadsheets
---------------------------------------
* Analyzing and debugging hierarchies of multi-way local propagation constraints: http://pdf.aminer.org/000/548/003/analyzing_and_debugging_hierarchies_of_multi_way_local_propagation_constraints.pdf
* Multi-way versus one-way constraints in user interfaces: Experience with the DeltaBlue Algorithm: http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.38.2714&rep=rep1&type=pdf
* Graphical techniques in a spreadsheet for specifying user interfaces: http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.18.3001&rep=rep1&type=pdf
  - Use spreadsheets to define constraints, instead of using constraints to define spreadsheets

Distributed Spreadsheets
------------------------
Operation transforms for a distributed shared spreadsheet: http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=289474
  - not all that relevant, but gives one possible approach to updating the formula/value pair: just clobber the formula
