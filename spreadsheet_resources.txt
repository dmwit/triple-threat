Google Scholar search for "bidirectional spreadsheet":
    * Bidirectional transformation of model-driven spreadsheets -- probably not relevant
    * patent on Data-bidirectional spreadsheet -- questionably relevant
    * Towards the Bidirectionalization of Spreadsheet Formulas -- relevant, but short, perhaps there were followups? if not, maybe ask them why it was hard/uninteresting
Tableau (tableausoftware.com); see also http://www.graphics.stanford.edu/projects/polaris/
browse HCI journals of the last few years to look for people to contact -- even related but not identical ideas should be good people to ask about whether there's work in the area
5000 spreadsheets: http://esquared.unl.edu/wikka.php?wakka=EUSESSpreadsheetCorpus

...related to constraint lenses, which will likely have to appear in some form or other if we're going to allow locking cells in the spreadsheet:
constraint logic programming
convex hulls (what are these?)
