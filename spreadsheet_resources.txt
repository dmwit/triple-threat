Google Scholar search for "bidirectional spreadsheet":
    * Bidirectional transformation of model-driven spreadsheets -- probably not relevant
    * patent on Data-bidirectional spreadsheet -- questionably relevant
    * Towards the Bidirectionalization of Spreadsheet Formulas -- relevant, but short, perhaps there were followups? if not, maybe ask them why it was hard/uninteresting
Tableau (tableausoftware.com); see also http://www.graphics.stanford.edu/projects/polaris/
browse HCI journals of the last few years to look for people to contact -- even related but not identical ideas should be good people to ask about whether there's work in the area

constraint programming and spreadsheets
    * A Spreadsheet Interface For Logic Programming http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=67450.67466
    * Survey: Practical Applications of Constraint Programming http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.43.9494&rep=rep1&type=pdf
    * Forms/3: A first-order visual language to explore the boundaries of the spreadsheet paradigm ftp://ftp.engr.orst.edu/pub/burnett/Forms3.JFP.pdf
Operation transforms for a distributed shared spreadsheet: http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=289474
    (not all that relevant, but gives one possible approach to updating the formula/value pair: just clobber the formula)
A spreadsheet based on constraints: http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=168642.168664
    very relevant! instead of giving formulas for particular cells, the relationship between cells is specified and an update to any of the related cells causes the others to recompute
An Explanation-Based, Visual Debugger for One-way Constraints: http://academic.research.microsoft.com/Publication/1242101/an-explanation-based-visual-debugger-for-one-way-constraints
    allowing people to run a spreadsheet "backwards" to figure out why a particular cell has a particular value

...related to constraint lenses, which will likely have to appear in some form or other if we're going to allow locking cells in the spreadsheet:
constraint logic programming
convex hulls (what are these?)
