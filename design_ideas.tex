The goal is to take the theme ``bidirectional spreadsheet'' and run with it.
In particular we'd like to design something that would be helpful to
business people---who are familiar with normal unidirectional
spreadsheets---when they realize that a particular computation hasn't come
out the way they wanted it to, and are trying to figure out a way to guide
their business so that it comes out that way in the future.

(TODO: give a running example, so the drawbacks outlined in later sections
don't come as a surprise)

\section{Literal Interpretation}
One basic design idea is to simply describe the connections between cells
(called ``formulas'' in traditional spreadsheets) via a lens rather than a
one-way function. We can do this whenever:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item We know how to turn a particular math operator into a lens, that
        is, there's a ``good'' interpretation of inverting the operation.
    \item The formulas refer to each other in simple enough ways that we
        can use the monoidal structure of the category of lenses without
        relying on traced or cartesian structure (since we don't have
        those).
\end{enumerate}

In fact, when these conditions are satisfied, the lens laws tell us that
there is a \emph{unique} update to the spreadsheet induced by the lenses'
get and put functions.

To be specific, the second condition above can be formalized in the
following way. We identify a set $C$ of cell names, a set $T$ of types, and
a finite partial map $f \in C \to T$ giving the type of data stored in each
cell. We say a lens has spreadsheet-type $c_1 \times \cdots \times c_n
\slens c$ when $c, c_1, \ldots, c_n$ are pairwise distinct and the lens has
lens type $f(c_1) \times \cdots \times f(c_n) \lens f(c)$. Given a
collection of lenses and corresponding spreadsheet types, we can create a
directed graph whose nodes are $C$ and where there is an edge $(c,c')$ for
each lens whose type has the form $c_1 \times \cdots \times c' \times \cdots
c_n \slens c$. We say a collection of lenses has \emph{simple structure}
when there is at most one \emph{undirected} path between any pair of nodes.

This is a fairly restrictive structural restriction, but note that it does
allow two (possibly surprising) setups: first, a given cell can have
multiple formulas associated with it, provided that they depend on disjoint
cell sets; second, multiple formulas can depend on a single cell, provided
the cells they output to are depended on by disjoint cell sets.

Suppose we now change the value in cell $c$. Pseudocode to update the rest
of the spreadsheet looks like this:

\newcommand\assign{\mathop{:=}}
\newcommand\modified{\mathit{modified}}
\newcommand\domain{\mathit{domain}}
\newcommand\codomain{\mathit{codomain}}
\begin{tabular}{l}
$\modified\assign\{c\}$ \\
iterate to fixpoint: \\
\qquad $k \assign $(nondeterministically) any lens \\
\qquad $f \assign $(nondeterministically) get or put \\
\qquad reject the choice when we would overwrite old work, i.e. when: \\
\qquad\qquad $k.f.\domain \cap \modified = \emptyset$ and $k.f.\codomain \cap \modified \ne \emptyset$ \\
\qquad run $k.f$ \\
\qquad $\modified \assign \modified \cup k.f.\codomain$
\end{tabular}

One should immediately ask whether this definition is really good, that is,
whether it terminates and is convergent. Showing these things relies
critically on the simple structure property, which gives us the crucial fact
that each cell changes its value at most once (in exactly the iteration
where it is added to the $\modified$ set).

(TODO: write down this argument carefully)

\newcommand{\tax}{\mathit{tax}}
\newcommand{\base}{\mathit{base}}
\newcommand{\total}{\mathit{total}}
The approach outlined above is simple to describe and implement, and it
reuses a lot of domain knowledge we have built up about lenses, but its
restrictions are strong enough that even fairly reasonable-looking
spreadsheets are excluded. For example, consider a spreadsheet with just
three cells named ``base'', ``tax'', and ``total''. We could imagine writing
a lens between base and tax that preserves the formula
$\tax=0.08*\base$, and similarly a lens between base, tax, and total
that preserves the formula $\total=\base+\tax$. However, the structure
restriction above is not satisfied in this spreadsheet: there are two paths
in the dependency graph from total to base (one that goes through tax and
one that doesn't).

Additionally, it isn't clear how to handle multi-update (that is, setting
the values of several cells simultaneously) or constrained update (that is,
fixing the values of some cells during the update process). The next two
sections discuss ways to address these shortcomings.

\section{Linear Algebra}
Consider again the simple three-cell spreadsheet with two equations:
\begin{align*}
    \tax &= 0.08*\base \\
    \total &= \base+\tax
\end{align*}
We might observe that the $\total$ equation could be rewritten in terms of
just $\base$:
\begin{align*}
    \tax   &= 0.08*\base \\
    \total &= 1.08*\base
\end{align*}
The lenses implementing these two equations \emph{do} have the simple
structure property. One may wonder in exactly which circumstances such a
refactoring can be done -- and whether it could be done automatically. In
the following, we suggest one circumstance in which we can do quite well in
that direction.

Suppose for the moment that each lens' get is a linear function, and that
the dependency graph is acyclic. (Being acyclic is a significant relaxation
from the simple structure property, but being linear functions is a
significant strengthening of the ``any lens will do'' attitude from the
previous approach.) Call a cell a ``root cell'' if it has no out edges --
that is, none of the linear formulas in the spreadsheet output to root
cells. A simple argument shows that, given a cell in the spreadsheet, we
can write a linear formula which maps the values of root cells to the value
of the given cell. The argument goes by induction on the length of the
longest path from a root cell to the given one, and proceeds as in the
example above by substituting in linear formulas for each non-root variable
at each step. In fact, we can go a step farther: we can write linear
transformations from root cells to any set of cells. If we manage to give a
characterization of when these linear transformations can be
bidirectionalized, then we will have given an account of how to handle the
multi-update problem and relax the simple structure requirement in the parts
of the spreadsheet where only linear formulae are used.

Thus, we can now frame our problem in another way: what is the right way to
bidirectionalize a linear transformation? Accordingly, we will now step away
from spreadsheets and frame our discussion in linear algebra terms.

(old text:)
This gives us a way to update non-root cells when any root cell changes. We
now ask: how should we update root cells when a non-root cell changes? Let
us return to the example for a moment, but add cells for several kinds of
products.  The original spreadsheet looks like this:
\begin{align*}
    \tax_i &= 0.08*\base_i \\
    \total_i &= \base_i+\tax_i \\
    \total &= \sum_{i}\total_i
\end{align*}
We compute the following linear functions in terms of the root cells
$\base_i$:
\begin{align*}
    \total_i &= 1.08*\base_i \\
    \total &= \sum_i 1.08*\base_i
\end{align*}
Now we set the $\total$. Because $\total$ depends on many root cells, there
are many updates to choose from: we could push all of the change into, say,
$\base_0$, keeping all the others the same; or spread the change evenly; or
many other strategies. In the following, we will choose the following
desiderata: we wish to find the change to the root cells which minimizes the
L2-norm.

(TODO: show how to solve the multi-update problem ``optimally'')

Pending research:
\begin{itemize}
    \item How do we solve constrained update ``optimally''?
    \item Can we generalize these observations? (What operations did we
        really need above? Can we be polymorphic over a theory that offers
        these operations? Are there other known instantiations of that
        theory?)
    \item how do the Shostak algorithm and Groebner bases fit in?
\end{itemize}
\section{Multiway Lenses}
(TODO: motivate multiway lenses (why did we move to these?); give
definition; show id and ``composition''; mention properties of composition;
perhaps define a few others?)

Pending research:
\begin{itemize}
    \item more syntax and a big example
    \item other ideas we can take from process calculi? (e.g. name hiding,
        two different kinds of composition, etc.)
    \item types
    \item how do multicategories fit in?
\end{itemize}
